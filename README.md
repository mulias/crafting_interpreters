# Hail fellow & well met, would you care to Craft some Interpreters?

[Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) is a great (free!) book for learning how to build an interpreted programming language. This repo includes a couple different implementations of lox, using different language and covering different sections of the book.

- `rlox` implements a lox tree-walk interpreter in Ruby
- `zlox` implements a lox bytecode interpreter in Zig
- `plover` implements a lox tree-walk interpreter in Roc. It's currently blocked
    on a bug in the Roc compiler.
